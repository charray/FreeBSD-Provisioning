Here are some provisioning scripts for FreeBSD cloud and physical instances.  Simply put the script in execution, and one can quickly achieve some clean and neat environment.  The scripts are provided with a hope that they are useful and inspiring. They are, however, not guaranteed to be accurate for readers' contexts. Be cautious.
